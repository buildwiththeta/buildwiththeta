## Motivation: embracing open-source for ethical and technical reasons

At Theta, we believe in the power of open source and its potential to foster innovation, collaboration, and transparency. By making Theta Playground open source, we aim to create an inclusive environment where developers and designers can come together to learn, share ideas, and contribute to the growth of the community.

Ethically, open source aligns with our vision of empowering individuals and teams to create exceptional digital experiences. It promotes knowledge sharing, breaks down barriers, and enables developers to build upon existing work, accelerating the pace of innovation.

From a technical standpoint, open source allows us to expose our codebase to scrutiny, encouraging community involvement in identifying and resolving issues. The collective expertise of the community helps us refine and enhance the quality, reliability, and security of Theta Playground and Theta.

By opening up our code, we invite developers from diverse backgrounds to join us in shaping the future of app development. Together, we can push the boundaries of what is possible and create a more inclusive and accessible digital ecosystem.

## Getting started

In Theta, we [rps](https://pub.dev/packages/rps) for command shortcuts.

You can install rps by running the following command:

```dart
dart pub global activate rps
```

**To run Theta Playground**, execute the following command to generate the code:

```dart
rps gen
```

Then, run the app:

```dart
rps run
```

We recommend using the latest version of Flutter and running on the web or desktop for the optimal experience.

## Differences between Theta Playground and [Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com)

- Theta Playground serves as a dedicated UI editor, providing a platform for experimentation and exploration.
- Unlike Theta, Theta Playground is not directly connected to the Theta platform or any backend services.
- Currently, Theta Playground does not support saving designs. However, we are actively working on implementing this functionality in the future.

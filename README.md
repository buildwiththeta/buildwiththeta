# The open source way of designing remote UI

[Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com) is an open source tool to streamline remote UI creation and testing, without the need for rebuilding.

- [x] Theta Studio: no-code visual editor for reponsive and modern UIs.
- [x] Theta Flutter client: Stream your UIs inside your clients. [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/theta)

## Why Theta?

Designed to facilitate quick UI designing, Theta streamlines the creation of dynamic interfaces directly within your app clients. Theta is not a no-code app builder. Instead, it allows developers to incorporate Theta into their existing workflows, ensuring seamless integration without compromising on code quality. With Theta, you can design a responsive app bar and view it within a Flutter app in mere minutes.

Here are some of Theta's defining features:

### Available Features

- **Absolute Positioning**: Design elements with absolute positioning, similar to Figma.
- **Responsive Design**: Create responsive elements and interfaces.
- **Theta Integration**: Incorporate Theta into your app using the Theta Flutter library.
- **Code and No-Code Mix**: Use workflows to combine no-code and code, e.g., run a method when a node is tapped.
- **Loading and Error Handling**: Efficiently manage loading and error handling in remote widgets.
- **Light and Dark Modes**: Support for dark and light UI themes.
- **Node Overrides**: Override any single node from your app.

# [Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com): UI injection for Flutter apps

Prototype and test dynamic user interfaces with instant fly-on-air updates. You can update the user interface without rebuilding it. You can directly set up remote A/B tests and see the analysis to improve UX and sales.

- Documentation: https://docs.buildwiththeta.com

You can run UI/UX tests in your app with Theta on the following platforms:

- **iOS** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta), Swift coming soon)
- **Android** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta))
- **Web** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta))
- **VisionOS** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta), Swift coming soon)
- **macOS** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta), Swift coming soon)
- **Windows** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta))

## Why Theta?

Building a Flutter app means you will take little time to program it from scratch, but you will spend almost all your time updating and testing it to improve UX and sales.

But testing and updating even small parts of our app's UI (e.g., paywalls, news dialogs, or even text copy) is a mechanism that requires putting hands on code and wasting a lot of time with each change.

This is crazy, which is why I created a tool to update and test apps in production with a few clicks. Integrate Theta to get started right away: buildwiththeta.com

### Developers shouldn't hardcode UI components

Server-driven design systems focus on creating dynamic user interfaces (UIs) that can be updated in real-time via APIs. Instead of hardcoding design components into the app, they are stored remotely. This allows central updates that are propagated instantly across all instances of the app, without the need for user downloads.

Theta offers several advantages:
- **‚ö°Ô∏è Integrate tonight:** Theta provides a UI editor for designing the UI that can be integrate directly into your project with SDKs. Theta doesn‚Äôt limit what you can do with the rest of your app. You can embed complex platform-specific widgets like maps, web views, media players, and camera feeds within your remote UI, or add a UIBox() inside an existing custom page to make it dynamic.
- **üîÄ Set tests remotely with instant effects:** Set up numerous A/B tests on your UI components to improve the user experience and sales of your app. Everything can be done visually on Theta, with a direct connection (and effect) to your customers' apps without wasting time.
- **üßã Team collaboration and version control:** Theta provides tools for team collaboration, project logs, and branches, facilitating efficient teamwork in app development. The version control feature allows tracking and management of different versions of the your design system components, a crucial aspect for maintaining app quality and addressing bugs or issues.
- **üí´ Efficiency:** Remote design systems like Theta allow for design updates to be rolled out instantly via API, across all instances of the app. This bypasses the traditional cycle of updating and downloading new app versions. Also, because the design system is centralized, it ensures a consistent look and feel across all platforms, enhancing the user experience.

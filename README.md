# [Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com): streamlined cross-platform server-driven UI

Build your server-driven design system effortlessly, without writing code. Seamlessly integrate it into your codebase alongside your preferred packages, enabling easy UI updates without the need to rebuild the entire app.

- Documentation: https://docs.buildwiththeta.com

You can share the remote user interface on the following platforms using Theta:

- **iOS** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta), Swift coming soon)
- **Android** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta))
- **Web** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta))
- **VisionOS** ([Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/theta), Swift coming soon)

## Why Theta?

Theta simplifies the creation and maintenance of remote design systems. It allows the user interface of front-end applications on different platforms to be updated in real time from a central cloud, eliminating the need for users to download a new version. 

### Developers shouldn't hardcode UI components

Server-driven design systems focus on creating dynamic user interfaces (UIs) that can be updated in real-time via APIs. Instead of hardcoding design components into the app, they are stored remotely. This allows central updates that are propagated instantly across all instances of the app, without the need for user downloads.

Theta offers several advantages:
- **‚ö°Ô∏è Integrate tonight**: Theta provides a no-code environment for designing the UI that can be integrate directly into your project with SDKs (Flutter, Swift coming soon). Theta doesn‚Äôt limit what you can do with the rest of your app. Developers can implement actions in whatever way they see fit, using the technologies they‚Äôre most comfortable with.
- **üîÄ Interoperability with your codebase**: Connect remote UI components with your code. You can embed complex platform-specific widgets like maps, web views, media players, and camera feeds within your remote UI, or add a UIBox() inside an existing custom page to make it dynamic.
- **üßã Team collaboration and version control:** Theta provides tools for team collaboration, project logs, and branches, facilitating efficient teamwork in app development. The version control feature allows tracking and management of different versions of the your design system components, a crucial aspect for maintaining app quality and addressing bugs or issues.
- **üí´ Efficiency:** Remote design systems like Theta allow for design updates to be rolled out instantly via API, across all instances of the app. This bypasses the traditional cycle of updating and downloading new app versions. Also, because the design system is centralized, it ensures a consistent look and feel across all platforms, enhancing the user experience.

## Integrate tonight

- **Sign up**
    - To begin your Theta journey, sign up for Theta on the [buildwiththeta.com](https://buildwiththeta.com) website.

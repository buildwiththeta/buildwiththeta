# Theta

Theta Flutter library.

- Docs: https://docs.page/buildwiththeta/buildwiththeta/


## What is [Theta](https://buildwiththeta.com)?

Theta is a platform designed for rendering dynamic user interfaces seamlessly within your Flutter applications.

- Effortless dynamic UI rendering: Display no-code UIs by eliminating the need to deploy or rebuild the app for each change.
- Custom code directly from within your app, mixing no-code and code.
- Test the user interface against various conditions and user properties in real time to help you find the best user experience.
- Lightweight and secure.

## How it works?

- Design interfaces on Theta (Figma import and AI generative generation support are planned in the future).
- Add the user interface elements within the app.
- Update the UI without rebuilding the app.

## Getting started

### Initialize Theta

Initialize Theta by calling `Theta.initialize` with your anonymous key.
Be sure to call this method at the root of your app.

```dart
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
    await Theta.initialize(anonKey: 'thetaKey');

    // ...
}
```

### Wrap your app with ThetaProvider

Wrap your app with `ThetaProvider` to enable any UIBox to receive the theme and project styles.
    
```dart
ThetaProvider(
    theme: ThemeMode.light,
    child: MaterialApp(
        home: // ...
    ),
)
```

### Render remote UI

Everything you need to do is to add a `UIBox` widget to your app and pass the component name as a parameter.

```dart
return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: UIBox('Component name'),
    ),
);
```

### Loading placeholder and error handling

You can display a placeholder widget during loading and an error widget.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Homepage',
    placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    errorWidget: (error) => Text(error),
)
```

### Add custom code for actions

Want a dynamic UI with gesture support (onTap, doubleTap, etc.)? You can add functions, called 'workflows', based on gesture triggers.

- Select a single UI element based on its id or name.
- Choose the trigger for which the action will start.
- Add a method.

```dart
UIBox(
    'AppBar',
    workflows: [
        Workflow('Container s4l3s', Trigger.onTap, () {
            // Do something
        }),
    ],
)
```

# How to run Flutter's Theta sample app

To get Theta's example app started in Flutter just go to the example folder inside the builder package. 
You can then run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## Set up the project

1. On line 9, change the placeholder 'thetaKey' to your own anonymous key.
2. On line 35, change the name of the UIBox to the name of the component you want to display. By default, all the first components of each project are named homepage.

---

Running it, you will see a blank page with the component created inside Theta. With this demo you can see how it behaves inside a Flutter app, trying responsive modes and trying to mix your own design with custom code through workflows (you will find the examples already written inside main.dart)

<Warning>Caution: in this test project, the cache has been disabled in line 8. It is advisable, however, to keep it always active in your projects to avoid rebuilding the application too many times.</Warning>

Have fun!

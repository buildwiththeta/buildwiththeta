# Override element properties

You can override each UI block with a Flutter widget by mixing no-code with Flutter. 

## Text override

```dart
UIBox(
    'Button',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Label')
            ..setText('Click me!'),
    ],
),
```

## Image override

```dart
UIBox(
    'Social Card',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Image')
            ..setImage('https://...'),
    ],
),
```

## Color override (`Container` background color and `Text` color)

```dart
UIBox(
    'Social Card',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Post Title')
            ..setColor(Colors.white, 0.5),
    ],
),
```

## Child override

If in the no-code component the element to which you want to overwrite the child already has one, 
it will be removed and replaced with the one entered by the user via code.

You can also use the `UIBox` within other `UIBox`es. This provides a very high degree of customization.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Element id')
            ..setChild(UIBox('Other component')),
    ],
),
```

## Children override

You can also overwrite the children of an element. 

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Element name')
            ..setChildren([Text('Child 1'), Text('Child 2')]),
    ],
),
```

<Warning>It is recommended to use only one Override per element, as only the first one is taken.</Warning>

<Warning>If you accidentally try to overwrite children to an element with only one child, the change by code will simply be ignored.</Warning>

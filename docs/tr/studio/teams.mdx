# Teams
**Theta uses teams to provide personal and collaborative experiences.<br/>Each team can consist of a single member or multiple users.**

A personal team can be used for individual development projects and a multi-user team for collaboration with other members.<br/>
Each project belongs to a team, and each project can have different branches for different environments or versions.

To share the personal team with other members, simply invite them via e-mail from the 'Team Settings' menu.
All projects will be automatically shared with other invited members.

# Security Policy

At Theta, we place the utmost priority on ensuring the security of our systems. Despite our best efforts, vulnerabilities may still be present, so we encourage you to help us by reporting any vulnerabilities you discover. Your assistance in safeguarding our clients and our systems is greatly appreciated.

When reporting a vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

- Contact us by emailing [security@buildwiththeta.com](security@buildwiththeta.com). We ask that you please do not disclose the vulnerability to anyone else until it has been resolved.
- Do not use automated scanners on our infrastructure or dashboard without our prior permission. If you wish to conduct this type of testing, please contact us.
- Please do not exploit any vulnerabilities you discover. For example, do not download more data than necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability or modify other users' data.
- Please provide us with enough information to replicate the vulnerability, so we can resolve it quickly.

In return, we promise the following:

- We will respond to your report within two-three business days and provide an expected timeline for resolving the issue.
- We will not pursue legal action against you if you have followed the guidelines outlined above.
- We will handle your report with the utmost confidentiality and will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent.
- We will keep you updated on our progress in resolving the issue.
- We will credit you as the discoverer of the issue, unless you prefer otherwise, when we publicly disclose information about the resolved vulnerability.
Please note that any attempts to exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes or engage in any other malicious activities will not be tolerated, and we reserve the right to take appropriate action in response to such behavior.

Thank you for your cooperation in helping us maintain the security of our systems.

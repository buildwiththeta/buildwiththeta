# Account deletion policy

Account deletion consists of deleting all of the account's personal data, projects, teams, and event logs made in the app.

Your security is of utmost importance to us. As a result, we’ve implemented a policy that requires you to delete your account from within our system rather than through an email request. This policy ensures that only you, as the account holder, can make the decision to delete your account.

## Why an email request is not sufficient

While we strive to provide you with excellent customer service, and this often involves accommodating requests via email, we cannot accept account deletion requests through email due to the following security reasons:

- Email can be compromised: Email accounts can be hacked, and messages can be intercepted. It’s not completely secure to send sensitive requests via email.
- Identity verification: It’s hard for us to verify your identity through email. Someone could pretend to be you and request to delete your account.

## When an account cannot be deleted

- Deleting a user is possible if the user is not an owner of a team with active billing. 

You can check whether your team's billing is considered active from the team settings menu.
In this case, deleting the user will result in an error and you will not be able to complete the action until the user assigns ownership of the team to another member.

## Whenever possible

- In case the user is an owner of teams with inactive billing his deletion will result in the deletion of the team and all associated projects and data.
- In case the user is only a member, but not an owner, of a team with active billing, his deletion will result in his automatic removal as a member of the team and the decrease of one seat from billing.

## How to delete your account

To ensure your account is securely deleted, please follow these steps:

- Login to your account: Visit our website and log in to your account using your credentials.
- Navigate to the profile page: Once you’re logged in, go to your profile page.
- Delete your account: Look for a “Delete Account” or “Deactivate Account” option. Before confirming the deletion, please read the information provided about what happens when you delete your account.

Please note that deleting your account is a permanent action and cannot be undone. Make sure you have saved any information you may need in the future before proceeding with the deletion.

We appreciate your understanding and cooperation with this policy. It’s designed with your security in mind. If you need any help with this process, please contact our support team.

# User deletion

User deletion consists of deleting all of the user's personal data, projects, teams, and event logs made in the app.

## When it is not possible

- Deleting a user is possible if the user is not an owner of a team with active billing. 

You can check whether your team's billing is considered active from the team settings menu.
In this case, deleting the user will result in an error and you will not be able to complete the action until the user assigns ownership of the team to another member.

## Whenever possible

- In case the user is an owner of teams with inactive billing his deletion will result in the deletion of the team and all associated projects and data.
- In case the user is only a member, but not an owner, of a team with active billing, his deletion will result in his automatic removal as a member of the team and the decrease of one seat from billing.

# Migration from Teta to Theta

If you are currently using Teta and would like to migrate your data to Theta, we offer a dedicated data migration service to make the transition as smooth as possible. Please note that while Theta and Teta share some similarities, Theta is built for a different purpose and has a different scope.

## Getting Started

To request a data migration from Teta to Theta, please visit https://buildwiththeta.com/migration and fill out the form with the following information:

- First and last name
- Email
- Project IDs (separated by commas)

To find your project IDs, simply open a project in Teta and copy the numeric ID from the URL, which should look something like this: .../editor/$projectId/...

‚ùó Please note that data migration may not be possible for all projects, as Theta uses a different database structure and certain nodes may no longer be used in the new product. We will review each migration request on a case-by-case basis to determine if it is possible.

## Migration Timeline
Please note that the migration process from Teta to Theta may take some time to complete. Due to the differences in structures and functionalities between the two platforms, the migration process requires careful planning and execution. We strive to make the transition as smooth as possible, but please understand that it may not be an immediate process.

## What Can Be Migrated

The following data can be migrated from Teta to Theta:

- Projects
- Channels for each project
- Pages and components for each channel
- Nodes for each page or component

## Grounds for Rejection

Please note that we reserve the right to reject migration requests for the following reasons:

- Name and email provided do not match the data saved in Teta
- Incorrect project IDs provided
- Project deemed unsuitable or inappropriate for migration
- Inappropriate content inside projects
- Technical infeasibility of migration for specific reasons

Thank you for considering Theta as your new platform, and we look forward to assisting you with the data migration process.

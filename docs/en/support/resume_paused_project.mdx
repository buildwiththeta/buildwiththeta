1. Go inside your paused project from [Theta dashboard](https://app.buildwiththeta.com).
2. In the upper left corner, click on the name of the project.
3. Enable 'Public' field.
4. Save.

Your project is now accessible via the API.


## Why are my projects paused? 

Because we are a small project, and we want to save unused system resources to make the best use of them.

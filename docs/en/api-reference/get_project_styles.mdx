# Get project styles

To retrieve all the styles (colors, text styles) of a project, you can make a POST request to the 'get_project_styles' endpoint of the Build with Theta API. Here's a sample curl command to do that:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.buildwiththeta.com/functions/v1/get_project_styles' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
      "title": "Get styles",
    }'
```

# Get component

To retrieve a remote component, you can make a POST request to the 'get_component' endpoint of the Build with Theta API. Here's a sample curl command to do that:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://component.api.buildwiththeta.net' \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOi...' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
      "title": "Get component",
      "branch_name": "...",
      "component_name": "...",
    }'
```

# Theta Builder

## What is Theta Builder?
Theta Builder is a package designed for rendering dynamic user interfaces seamlessly within your Flutter applications.
- Effortless dynamic UI rendering: Display no-code UIs by eliminating the need to deploy or rebuild the app for each change.
- Custom code directly from within your app, mixing no-code and code.
- Test the user interface against various conditions and user properties in real time to help you find the best user experience.
- Lightweight and secure.

## How it works?
1. Design interfaces on Theta (Figma import and AI generative generation support are planned in the future).
2. Add the user interface elements within the app.
3. Update the UI without rebuilding the app.

## Status
Public Alpha: No breaking changes expected in future but possible bugs.

## Usage example

### Initializing

```dart
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
    await Theta.initialize(
        project_id: 0, // Your project id
        key: 'xyz', // Your token
    );
}
```

### UI basic rendering

All you have to do is write the name of the UI component inside a UIBox widget.

```dart
/// Your app
return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: UIBox('Component name'),
    ),
);
```

### Add custom code for actions

Want a dynamic UI with gesture support (onTap, doubleTap, etc.)? You can add custom code, called 'workflow' based on gesture triggers.

1. Select a single UI element based on its id.
2. Choose the trigger for which the action will start.
3. Add your code.

```dart
UIBox(
    'CupertinoAppBar',
    workflows: [
        Workflow('Element id', Trigger.onTap, (context) {
            /// Your method
        }),
    ]
)
```

### Parameters and states

In Theta Studio, you can declare params and states inside your UI interfaces. You can override their values with custom values using UIBox as following:

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component Name',
    parameters: [
        Var('name', value: 'abc'),
        // other parameters ...
    ],
    states: [
        Var('name', value: 2),
    ],
)
```

### Loading placeholder and error handling

You can display a placeholder widget during loading and a custom error widget.

```dart
UIBox(
    'CupertinoAppBar',
    placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    errorWidget: (error) => Text('Something went wrong, error: $error'),
)
```

### Channel versioning (also for AB tests)

It is possible to have multiple UIs with the same name but different channels (versions).

```dart
UIBox(
    'ArticleCard',
    channel_id: 'Channel id', // You can retrieve it from app.buildwiththeta.com
)

// You can select different versions depending on your needs
UIBox(
    'ArticleCard',
    channel_id: env == Environment.production ? 'ChannelId1' 'ChannelId2',
)
```

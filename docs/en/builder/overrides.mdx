# Override element properties

You can override each UI block with a Flutter widget by mixing no-code with Flutter. 

## Text override

```dart
UIBox(
    'Button',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Label')
            ..setText('Click me!'),
    ],
),
```

## Image override

```dart
UIBox(
    'Social Card',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Image')
            ..setImage('https://...'),
    ],
),
```

## Color override (`Container` background color and `Text` color)

```dart
UIBox(
    'Social Card',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Post Title')
            ..setColor(Colors.white, 0.5),
    ],
),
```

## Child override

If in the no-code component the element to which you want to overwrite the child already has one, 
it will be removed and replaced with the one entered by the user via code.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Element id')
            ..setChild(UIBox('Other component')),
    ],
),
```

## Children override

You can also overwrite the children of an element. 

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override('Element name')
            ..setChildren([Text('Child 1'), Text('Child 2')]),
    ],
),
```

## Mixing of different UIBox(es)

You can also use the `UIBox` within other `UIBox`es. This provides a very high degree of customization.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Wrapper Widget',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            'Element id',
            props: [
                ChildProperty(child: UIBox('Primary Button')),
            ],
        ),
    ],
),
```

<Warning>It is recommended to use only one Override per element, as only the first one is taken.</Warning>

<Warning>If you accidentally try to overwrite children to an element with only one child, the change by code will simply be ignored.</Warning>

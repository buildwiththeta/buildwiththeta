# Override node properties

## Override child

You can override the child of a node with a Flutter widget by mixing no-code with Flutter. 
If in the no-code component the node to which you want to overwrite the child already has one, 
it will be removed and replaced with the one entered by the user via code.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-id',
            props: [
                ChildProperty(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
            ],
        ),
    ],
),
```

## Override children

You can also overwrite the children of a node. 

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-name',
            props: [
                ChildrenProperty(children: [
                    Text('Click me!'),
                    // other widgets
                ]),
            ],
        )
    ],
),
```

## Mixing of different `UIBox`

You can also use the `UIBox` within other `UIBox`es. This provides a very high degree of customization.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Wrapper Widget',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-id',
            props: [
                ChildProperty(child: UIBox('Primary Button')),
            ],
        ),
    ],
),
```

<Warning>It is recommended to use only one Override per widget, as only the first one is taken.</Warning>

<Warning>If you accidentally try to overwrite children to a node with only one child, the change by code will simply be ignored.</Warning>

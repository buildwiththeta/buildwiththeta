# How to run Flutter's Build with Theta sample app

Navigate to [Theta's example app](https://github.com/buildwiththeta/buildwiththeta/blob/main/packages/builder/example/lib/main.dart).

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  /// Initialize Theta instance.
  /// You can get an anonymous key at https://app.buildwiththeta.com
  await Theta.initialize(anonKey: 'Theta Key', cacheEnabled: false);

  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  State<MyApp> createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  final _controller = UIBoxController();

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    _controller.onLoaded(() {
      debugPrint('Loaded!');
    });
    _controller.onError((error) => debugPrint(error.toString()));
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    _controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    /// ThetaProvider is used to provide the project styles to the widgets.
    return ThetaProvider(
      theme: ThemeMode.light,
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          /// UIBox is used to build the UI. It requires the component name.
          body: UIBox(
            'Your component',
            controller: _controller,

            /// [placeholder] is the widget displayed while the page is loading.
            placeholder: const CircularProgressIndicator(),

            /// [errorWidget] is the widget displayed if an error occurs.
            errorWidget: (error) => Text(error.toString()),

            /// [overrides] are the properties that can be overriden by the user.
            overrides: [
              /// Override an [element] with a custom widget still having the original [element] child.
              Override(
                'node id',
                builder: (context, node, child, children) {
                  return GestureDetector(
                    onTap: () {
                      debugPrint('Tapped!');
                    },
                    child: Container(
                      color: Colors.black,
                      child: child,
                    ),
                  );
                },
              ),

              /// Or override a text element with a custom text value and color.
              Override(
                'node id',
                text: 'Click me!',
                color: Colors.blue,
              ),
            ],

            /// [workflows] are the workflows that can be triggered by the user, mixing no-code and code.
            workflows: [
              Workflow(
                'node id',
                Trigger.onTap,
                () => debugPrint('Tapped!'),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## Set up the project

1. Add your own Anon Key. You can find it inside your projects at [app.buildwiththeta.com](https://app.buildwiththeta.com).
2. Change the `name` parameters of the UIBox to the name of the component you want to display.

## Run

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

---

Running it, you will see a blank page with the component created inside Theta. With this demo you can see how it behaves inside a Flutter app, trying responsive modes and trying to mix your own design with custom code through workflows (you will find the examples already written inside main.dart)

<Warning>Caution: in this test project, the cache has been disabled. It is advisable, however, to keep it always active in your projects to avoid rebuilding the application too many times.</Warning>

Have fun!

# Getting started

Theta works between the [hosted](https://buildwiththeta.com) platform and client library. To get started:

- Sign up at [buildwiththeta.com](https://buildwiththeta.com) (An invite is required in closed beta).
- Create a new project and design your first interface.
- Copy the page the name you want mirror.
- Install [Theta client library](https://pub.dev/packages/theta) and use a `UIBox('name of the page')` to integrate the page within your app.

## System requirements

Theta is a web application that can be used from a browser. For optimal experience, please follow the system requirements:

- Working on a desktop or laptop is recommended.
- Use a screen of at least 12 inches.
- It is recommended to use Google Chrome (if you experience problems, please try to see if problems persist on Chrome).
- To do copy and paste within a project, allow the ClipBoard (a dialog box will appear at app.buildwiththeta.com)

## Designing your interface

- See [how to move and resize elements](https://docs.page/buildwiththeta/buildwiththeta/en/studio/positioning_and_resizing).
- See [how to set responsive constraints](https://docs.page/buildwiththeta/buildwiththeta/en/studio/constraints).

## Installing Theta client library

```
flutter pub add theta
```

### Initializing

Initialize Theta by calling Theta.initialize with your anonymous key. Be sure to call this method at the root of your app.

```dart
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
    await Theta.initialize(anonKey: 'thetaKey');
}
```

### Wrap your app with ThetaProvider 

Wrap your app with ThetaProvider to enable any UIBox to receive the theme and project styles.

```dart
ThetaProvider(
    theme: ThemeMode.light,
    child: MaterialApp(
        home: // ...
    ),
)
```

### Render remote UI 

Everything you need to do is to add a UIBox widget to your app and pass the component name as a parameter.

```dart
/// Your app
return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: UIBox('Component name'),
    ),
);
```

### Loading placeholder and error handling 

You can display a placeholder widget during loading and an error widget.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Homepage',
    placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    errorWidget: (error) => Text(error),
)
```

### Add custom code for actions

Want a dynamic UI with gesture support (onTap, doubleTap, etc.)? You can add custom code, called 'workflow' based on gesture triggers.

1. Select a single UI element based on its id or name.
2. Choose the trigger for which the action will start.
3. Add your code.

```dart
UIBox(
    'CupertinoAppBar',
    workflows: [
        Workflow('Element id', Trigger.onTap, (context) {
            /// Your method
        }),
    ]
)
```

### Override node properties

- children

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-name',
            props: [
                ChildrenProperty(children: [
                    Text('Click me!'),
                    // other widgets
                ]),
            ],
        )
    ],
),
```

- child

```dart
UIBox(
    'Component name',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-id',
            props: [
                ChildProperty(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
            ],
        ),
    ],
),
```

### Mixing of different UIBox

You can even use UIBoxes inside the other UIBoxes, putting them as children of each other. This gives a very high degree of customization.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Wrapper Widget',
    overrides: const [
        Override(
            nodeIdenfier: 'node-id',
            props: [
                ChildProperty(child: UIBox('Primary Button')),
            ],
        ),
    ],
),
```

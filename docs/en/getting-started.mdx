# Getting started

Theta works between the [hosted](https://buildwiththeta.com) platform and client library. To get started:

- Sign up at [buildwiththeta.com](https://buildwiththeta.com) (An invitation is required in closed beta).
- Create a new project and design your first interface.
- Copy the page the name you want mirror.
- Install [Theta client library](https://pub.dev/packages/theta) and use a `UIBox('name of the page')` to integrate the page within your app.

## Designing your interface

- See how to move and resize elements.
- See how to set responsive constraints.

## Installing Theta client library

```
flutter pub add theta
```

### Initializing

Initialize Theta by calling Theta.initialize with your anonymous key. Be sure to call this method at the root of your app.

```dart
import 'package:theta/theta.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
    await Theta.initialize(anonKey: 'thetaKey');
}
```

### Wrap your app with ThetaProvider 

Wrap your app with ThetaProvider to enable any UIBox to receive the theme and project styles.

```dart
ThetaProvider(
    theme: ThemeMode.light,
    child: MaterialApp(
        home: // ...
    ),
)
```

### Render remote UI 

Everything you need to do is to add a UIBox widget to your app and pass the component name as a parameter.

```dart
/// Your app
return Scaffold(
    body: Center(
        child: UIBox('Component name'),
    ),
);
```

### Loading placeholder and error handling 

You can display a placeholder widget during loading and an error widget.

```dart
UIBox(
    'Homepage',
    placeholder: CircularProgressIndicator(),
    errorWidget: (error) => Text(error),
)
```

### Add custom code for actions

Want a dynamic UI with gesture support (onTap, doubleTap, etc.)? You can add custom code, called 'workflow' based on gesture triggers.

1. Select a single UI element based on its id or name.
2. Choose the trigger for which the action will start.
3. Add your code.

```dart
UIBox(
    'CupertinoAppBar',
    workflows: [
        Workflow('Element id', Trigger.onTap, (context) {
            /// Your method
        }),
    ]
)
```

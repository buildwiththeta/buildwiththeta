Conversion events are a simple yet powerful way to track user actions in your app. 
With Build with Theta, we provide a straightforward conversion events system 
that allows you to easily monitor and analyze user interactions, 
all while prioritizing simplicity and ease of use.

## Tracking User Actions

Our conversion events system is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive. 
You can effortlessly track important user actions within your app, such as button taps, 
form submissions, or any other meaningful interaction. 

By defining custom conversion events, you gain valuable insights into how users engage 
with your app and can make informed decisions to enhance their experience.

## Privacy and Data Protection

At Build with Theta, we understand the importance of privacy and data protection. While our conversion events system is streamlined for simplicity, we still prioritize the security and privacy of user data. While we don’t use elaborate security methods, we do take essential measures to protect your data and ensure a safe environment for your users:

-	Limited Data Collection: We only collect the necessary data for conversion events, keeping it minimal and focused on the actions you choose to track. We don’t collect any personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure user anonymity.
-	Developer Control: As the developer, you have complete control over which conversion events to track. You decide which user actions are relevant to your app and enable tracking for those specific events.
-	Transparency and Consent: While our system doesn’t include an opt-in consent mechanism by default, it is your responsibility as the developer to obtain proper consent from your app users based on the requirements of relevant regulations, such as GDPR. We recommend incorporating a consent mechanism within your app to ensure transparency and compliance.
-	Data Retention: We retain conversion event data for a limited period necessary for analysis and insights. We do not store the data longer than required and ensure its secure disposal.

By keeping our conversion events system easy to use and respecting user privacy, we aim to provide a seamless experience for both developers and app users.

## Leveraging Conversion Event Insights

With our simplified conversion events system, you can gain actionable insights into user behavior and optimize your app accordingly. By leveraging the data collected from conversion events, you can refine your app’s design, enhance user engagement, and drive overall app performance. Our intuitive interface allows you to easily access and review the history of conversion event logs, enabling you to make informed decisions based on real-time user actions.

The Build with Theta conversion events system is designed to be straightforward and hassle-free. By focusing on simplicity and data protection, we provide developers like you with the tools to track and analyze user interactions effectively, empowering you to create exceptional app experiences.

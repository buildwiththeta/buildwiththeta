# Loose mode

Loose mode allows single-block components to be able to be displayed regardless of screen size, thus without an absolute position. These are super useful for being able to create widgets that can be embedded inside other widgets, thus without the need for absolute position.

An example? A button. Position and customize it wherever you like, if you enable Loose mode it will autonomously position itself in the center of the device.

Stretch alignments will still work, however, allowing you to see how a full-width button widens on different devices.

## The opposite: Expanded mode

By enabling Expanded mode (default on all components) then all blocks are positioned according to their absolute coordinates (or responsive alignments) taking against device size.

This mode is useful for creating complex components made from multiple widgets on the same layer, or for creating pieces of pages.
